Computer Fundamentals and Programming Methodology
1. Introduction
Computer fundamentals cover the essential principles of how computers work, including hardware, software, and their interactions. Programming methodology focuses on structured approaches to writing efficient and reliable code to solve problems.
2. Components of a PC
A personal computer (PC) consists of:

CPU (Central Processing Unit): The brain of the computer, executing instructions.
Motherboard: The main circuit board connecting all components.
RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary storage for running programs.
Storage: HDDs or SSDs for permanent data storage.
Power Supply Unit (PSU): Provides power to components.
GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): Handles visual output (optional for basic systems).

3. Computer Architecture
Computer architecture defines the structure and behavior of a computer system:

Von Neumann Architecture: A design where data and instructions are stored in the same memory, processed sequentially by the CPU.
Components: Includes the CPU (ALU, control unit, registers), memory, input/output systems, and buses for data transfer.

4. Memory Types

Primary Memory:
RAM: Volatile, fast, used for active processes.
ROM: Non-volatile, stores firmware or boot instructions.


Secondary Memory: Non-volatile, e.g., HDDs, SSDs, for long-term storage.
Cache Memory: High-speed memory between CPU and RAM for frequently accessed data.

5. Memory Hierarchy
The memory hierarchy organizes memory types by speed, cost, and capacity:

Registers: Fastest, inside CPU, smallest capacity.
Cache: Fast, near CPU, small capacity.
RAM: Slower than cache, larger capacity.
Secondary Storage: Slowest, largest capacity, cost-effective.
Purpose: Balances speed and cost for efficient data access.

6. Computer Peripherals
Peripherals are external devices connected to the computer:

Input Devices: Keyboard, mouse, scanner.
Output Devices: Monitor, printer, speakers.
Storage Devices: USB drives, external HDDs.

7. Input and Output Devices

Input Devices: Capture data from the user or environment (e.g., keyboard for text, microphone for audio).
Output Devices: Display or produce results (e.g., monitors for visuals, printers for hard copies).
I/O Interaction: Managed by the operating system and drivers.

8. Basics of Computer Networking

Definition: Connecting computers to share resources and data.
Key Concepts:
LAN (Local Area Network): Connects devices in a small area (e.g., home, office).
WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects larger areas (e.g., the internet).
Protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP for standardized communication.
Devices: Routers, switches, modems.



9. Computer Programming

Definition: Writing instructions (code) for computers to perform tasks.
Languages: C (as used in this repository), Python, Java, etc.
Purpose: Automate tasks, solve problems, create applications.

10. Steps for Program Development

Problem Definition: Identify the problem to solve.
Analysis: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
Design: Create algorithms, flowcharts, or pseudocode.
Coding: Write the program in a programming language (e.g., C).
Testing: Run the program to identify and fix errors.
Maintenance: Update and improve the program as needed.

11. Problem-Solving Tools

Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures to solve problems.
Flowcharts: Visual diagrams representing program flow.
Pseudocode: High-level, human-readable code descriptions.
Debugging Tools: IDEs, compilers, or print statements to find errors.

12. Algorithm Thinking and Flowchart

Algorithm Thinking: Logical approach to breaking down problems into steps.
Flowchart: Uses symbols (e.g., ovals for start/end, diamonds for decisions) to represent program logic.
Example: For arithmetic_operations.c, a flowchart would include:
Start → Input num1, num2 → Perform operations → Check if num2 is zero → Output results → End.



13. Pseudocode
Pseudocode for arithmetic_operations.c:
BEGIN
  DISPLAY "Enter first number: "
  INPUT num1
  DISPLAY "Enter second number: "
  INPUT num2
  DISPLAY "Addition: ", num1 + num2
  DISPLAY "Subtraction: ", num1 - num2
  DISPLAY "Multiplication: ", num1 * num2
  IF num2 != 0 THEN
    DISPLAY "Division: ", num1 / num2
    DISPLAY "Modulus: ", num1 % num2
  ELSE
    DISPLAY "Cannot divide by zero"
    DISPLAY "Cannot perform modulus by zero"
  ENDIF
END

14. Program Control Structures

Sequence: Executes statements in order (e.g., input → process → output).
Selection: Decision-making (e.g., if num2 != 0 in the program).
Iteration: Loops for repetitive tasks (not used in this program but common in others).

15. Programming Methodology

Structured Programming: Organizes code into modular, logical blocks (e.g., functions, conditionals).
Top-Down Design: Breaks problems into smaller subproblems.
Best Practices: Use clear variable names, comments, and error handling (e.g., checking for division by zero).

16. Programming Models

Procedural Programming: Used in arithmetic_operations.c, focuses on procedures/functions (e.g., main()).
Object-Oriented Programming: Organizes code into objects (not used here).
Functional Programming: Emphasizes functions without side effects.
