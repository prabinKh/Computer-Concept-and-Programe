## 1. Introduction to C

**Explanation**: C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. Known for its efficiency and low-level control, C is used in system programming, embedded systems, and application development. It forms the foundation for languages like C++ and Java.

**Key Features**:
- Structured programming with functions and control structures.
- Fast execution with minimal overhead.
- Direct memory access via pointers.
- Portable across platforms.

**Example Code: Library Menu**  
A program to display a menu for a library management system, demonstrating C’s simplicity.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Welcome to the Library Management System!\n");
    printf("1. Borrow Book\n2. Return Book\n3. Exit\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Used in user interfaces for library kiosks or ticketing systems.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Like the arithmetic program, this example uses basic output to interact with users, a core feature of C.

## 2. C Character Set

**Explanation**: The C character set includes letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), special characters (e.g., +, @, ;), and whitespace (space, tab, newline). These form the building blocks of C code.

**Example Code: Password Character Display**  
A program to show valid characters for a password validator.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char letter = 'A';
    char digit = '5';
    char special = '@';
    printf("Valid password characters:\n");
    printf("Letter: %c\nDigit: %c\nSpecial: %c\n", letter, digit, special);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Password validation in login systems ensures only allowed characters are used.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: The arithmetic program uses characters like +, /, and digits in prompts (e.g., "Enter first number: ").

## 3. Tokens

**Explanation**: Tokens are the smallest units in a C program, including keywords (e.g., `int`), identifiers (e.g., variable names), constants (e.g., 10), operators (e.g., +), and symbols (e.g., ;).

**Example Code: Rectangle Area Calculator**  
A program to calculate the area of a rectangle, highlighting tokens.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int length = 10;
    int width = 5;
    int area = length * width;
    printf("Area: %d\n", area);
    return 0;
}
```

**Tokens**:
- Keywords: `int`, `return`
- Identifiers: `length`, `width`, `area`
- Constants: `10`, `5`
- Operators: `=`, `*`
- Symbols: `;`, `()`, `{}`

**Real-Life Context**: Used in architectural software for space planning.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Similar use of operators (`*`) and constants (e.g., 3 in division).

## 4. Identifiers

**Explanation**: Identifiers are user-defined names for variables, functions, etc. Rules:
- Start with a letter or underscore.
- Include letters, digits, underscores.
- Case-sensitive.
- Not a keyword.

**Example Code: Employee Details**  
A program to store and display employee information.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int employee_id = 101;
    float employee_salary = 45000.50;
    char employee_grade = 'B';
    printf("Employee ID: %d\nSalary: %.2f\nGrade: %c\n", employee_id, employee_salary, employee_grade);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: HR systems use identifiers for employee records.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses identifiers like `num1`, `num2` for variables.

## 5. Keywords

**Explanation**: Keywords are reserved words (e.g., `int`, `if`, `return`) with specific meanings, not usable as identifiers.

**Example Code: Number Classifier**  
A program to check if a number is positive.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    if (number > 0) {
        printf("Positive\n");
    } else {
        printf("Non-positive\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Keywords**: `int`, `if`, `else`, `return`  
**Real-Life Context**: Financial systems check positive balances.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses `if` for zero-division check.

## 6. Constants

**Explanation**: Constants are fixed values: integers (`10`), floating-point (`3.14`), characters (`'A'`), strings (`"Hello"`).

**Example Code: Circle Area**  
A program to calculate the area of a circle using a constant.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
const float PI = 3.14159;
int main() {
    float radius = 7.0;
    float area = PI * radius * radius;
    printf("Circle Area: %.2f\n", area);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Engineering software for geometric calculations.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses constants like `'0'` in output strings.

## 7. Variables

**Explanation**: Variables are named memory locations that store changeable data, declared with a data type.

**Example Code: Inventory Tracker**  
A program to update stock levels.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int stock_quantity = 100;
    int items_sold = 25;
    stock_quantity = stock_quantity - items_sold;
    printf("Remaining Stock: %d\n", stock_quantity);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Inventory management in retail.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses variables `num1`, `num2`.

## 8. Data Types

**Explanation**: Data types define variable storage: `int` (4 bytes), `float` (4 bytes), `double` (8 bytes), `char` (1 byte), etc.

**Example Code: Product Details**  
A program to store product information.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int product_id = 5001;
    float product_price = 29.99;
    char product_category = 'E';
    double discount_rate = 0.15;
    printf("Product ID: %d\nPrice: %.2f\nCategory: %c\nDiscount: %.2f\n", 
           product_id, product_price, product_category, discount_rate);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: E-commerce product listings.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses `int` for `num1`, `num2`.

## 9. Type Conversion

**Explanation**: Type conversion changes data types: implicit (automatic) or explicit (casting).

**Example Code: Temperature Converter**  
A program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int celsius = 25;
    float fahrenheit = (float)(celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
    printf("Temperature: %.2f°F\n", fahrenheit);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Weather apps.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Implicit conversion in division (`num1 / num2`).

## 10. Operators and Expressions

**Explanation**: Operators include arithmetic (`+`, `-`), relational (`>`, `==`), logical (`&&`), etc. Expressions combine operands and operators.

**Example Code: Net Pay Calculator**  
A program to compute net pay after tax.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float gross_pay = 5000.0;
    float tax_rate = 0.2;
    float tax = gross_pay * tax_rate;
    float net_pay = gross_pay - tax;
    printf("Gross Pay: %.2f\nTax: %.2f\nNet Pay: %.2f\n", gross_pay, tax, net_pay);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Payroll systems.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.

## 11. Structure of a C Program

**Explanation**: A C program includes preprocessor directives (`#include`), `main` function, declarations, statements, and `return`.

**Example Code: Countdown Timer**  
A program to display a countdown.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int seconds = 5;
    while (seconds > 0) {
        printf("Time left: %d seconds\n", seconds);
        seconds--;
    }
    printf("Time's up!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Quiz apps or appliance timers.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Follows same structure with `#include` and `main`.

## 12. Managing Input and Output Operations

**Explanation**: Input uses `scanf`; output uses `printf` with format specifiers (`%d`, `%f`, `%c`).

**Example Code: User Feedback**  
A program to collect feedback.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char feedback[50];
    int rating;
    printf("Enter your feedback: ");
    scanf("%s", feedback);
    printf("Enter rating (1-5): ");
    scanf("%d", &rating);
    printf("Feedback: %s\nRating: %d/5\n", feedback, rating);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Customer feedback systems.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Uses `scanf` and `printf` for I/O.

## 13. Common Errors in Programming

**Explanation**: Errors include:
- **Syntax**: Missing `;`, wrong syntax.
- **Logical**: Incorrect logic.
- **Runtime**: Division by zero, invalid input.

**Example Code: Error-Prone Division**  
A program with error handling.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    if (y != 0) {
        printf("Result: %d\n", x / y);
    } else {
        printf("Error: Division by zero\n");
    }
    printf("Done\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Banking software prevents calculation errors.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Handles division by zero similarly.

## 14. Debugging Basics

**Explanation**: Debugging uses print statements, compilers, IDEs, and testing to fix errors.

**Example Code: Square Calculator**  
A program with debugging aids.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    printf("Debug: Input num = %d\n", num);
    int square = num * num;
    printf("Debug: Square = %d\n", square);
    printf("Square of %d is %d\n", num, square);
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Context**: Robotics sensor calculations.  
**Relation to `arithmetic_operations.c`**: Could add `printf` to debug `num1`, `num2`.
